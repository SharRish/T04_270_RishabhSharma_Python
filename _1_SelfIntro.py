Introduce yourself
==================

I am Rishabh Sharma and I have been a Python backend developer for about 4 and a half years now.

I work with Springsource technologies that is based out of bangalore and my recent client is EMC Data storage systems.
(I started my journey with Absolute Infotech during the first quarter of 2018, sometime in Feb. 
I then moved to EMC data storage sometime in January of 2021 and have been here since.)

Coming to my technical stack,
----------------------------
>>I have worked with frameworks such as Django, Django Rest, and Flask. Django is something I am 
extensively exposed to over Flask however I shouldn't have trouble using it if needed.
>>I have fair experience in front-end techs such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
>>I have interacted with databases like SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL for writing SQL queries, and
>>Versioning tool used: GitHub

My recent project was a Guitar tuition management system
--------------------------------------------------------
>>A website that connects anyone wanting to learn how to play the guitar with a simple click.
>>Here, people could check trainer details, and access snippets from the classes. 
>>Once becoming members, they would have access to flexible batch slots, guitar lessons, challenges, and all. The site would also allow trainers to sell guitars and related accessories.
>>The technologies that went into this were Python as the programming language, Django, DjangoRest 
framework, and the entirety of HTML, CSS, and JS for the front-end.

My roles and responsibilities during this time
----------------------------------------------
>>To gather requirements and help build code surrounding it,
>>Creating Django models,
>>Creating Django dashboard using Django CRM, and with
>>Authentication and Authorization of users.

Project Significance of Tuition Management System:
--------------------------------------------------
The goal of constructing this system is to improve data management. It's possible be used to replace the manual system in situations where the manual system isn't 
appropriate a different approach. Instead of manually recording information, which takes more time and money, this system allows you to add, save, delete, edit, and view records.
The task can be centralized, which means that the process of entering, handling, maintaining, and updating data can all be done in one place done
by a single member of staff The system's data will be protected maintain in a safe and secure manner. There is an authenticate level and a down level for senior management. 
Each user's ID and password are required for authentication.
