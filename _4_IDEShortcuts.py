1. Different ways to write python program.
    Interactive, IDLE, CommandPrompt, IDE 
    Advantages, Disadvantages
===========================================
IDE means integrated development enviroment. an 'IDE' is a tool/text editor with functions to make it easier to code, 
like an integrated compiler, auto-completing tags, etc. 'IDLE' is an specific IDE for Python. (Integrated Developement and Learning environment)

Software IDEs are where most software engineers spend their day. The same IDE will often support multiple languages 
(e.g. Python, Java, C++) and have a rich set of development tools like build scripts, debugging, profiling, 
version control integration, jump to definition, and code completion. If you have heard of Microsoft Visual Studio, 
it is a perfect example of a Software IDE.

A Python interactive session will allow you to write a lot of lines of code, but once you close the session, you 
lose everything you've written. That's why the usual way of writing Python programs is by using plain text files. 
By convention, those files will use the .py extension. 


1. Different IDEs in market
===========================
Integrated development environments (IDE) are applications that facilitates the development of other applications. 
Designed to encompass all programming tasks in one application, one of the main benefits of an IDE is that they offer 
a central interface with all the tools a developer needs, including:
>>Code editor: Designed for writing and editing source code, these editors are distinguished from text editors because 
  they work to either simplify or enhance the process of writing and editing of code for developers.
>>Compiler: Compilers transform source code that is written in a human readable/writable language in a form that computers can execute.
>>Debugger: Debuggers are used during testing and can help developers debug their application programs.
>>Build automation tools: These can help automate developer tasks that are more common to save time.

a. Multi-Language IDE
The multi-language IDEs - like Eclipse, Aptana, Komodo, NetBeans, and Geany

b. IDE for Mobile Development Processes
Specifically for mobile development, there are IDEs that include PhoneGap and Titanium Mobile from Appcelerator.

c. HTML IDE
IDEs for developing HTML applications are some of the most popular IDEs around. For example, DreamWeaver, HomeSite, and FrontPage

d. IDE Made for Certain Languages
There are specific IDEs that cater to programmers who work in one language. These include Jikes and Jcreator for Java, 
CodeLite and C-Free for C/C++, RubyMine for Ruby/Rails, and Idle for Python.


2. Advantages of IDE
====================
>>Faster setup: Programmers need to spend time configuring multiple development tools without an IDE interface in place.
>>Faster development tasks: the tools and features of the IDE help programmers organize resources, prevent mistakes, and implement shortcuts.
